                <h3>What is this all about?</h3>
                <p>On this site, you are allowed to post something that will appear on the page, every 24 hours. You can rant, advertise your website, ask a question, tell a random joke.</p>
                <p>You will be able to rate a post by its quality. A user that has quality posts will appear longer on the archive list. Gather some rep points! Watch out, you can go in the negatives if you post crap and people don't like it.</p>
                <p>The more rep you have, the bigger your impact on ratings will be.</p>
                <p>If you think someone said something that's utter bullshit, you can cancel them. If a post gets several cancel votes, they get loose a good portion of their rep</p>
